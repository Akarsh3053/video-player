  7-14|If you lined up all the blood vessels in your body, they'd be 95,000 km long.
  14-21|And every day, they carry the equivalent of over 7,500 liters of blood.
  21-26|Though that's actually the same 4 or 5 liters recycled over and over,
  27-33|delivering oxygen and precious nutrients like glucose and amino acids to the body's tissues.
  33-43|All that blood exerts a force on the muscular walls of the blood vessels.That force is called blood pressure,
  43-45|and it rises and falls with the phases of the heartbeat.
  45-50|When the heart is at rest between beats, blood pressure falls to its lowest value,
  50-52|the diastolic pressure.
  52-58|A typical healthy individual produces a systolic pressure between 90 and 120 mm of mercury
  58-63|and a diastolic pressure between 60 and 80.
  63-67|Taken together, a normal reading is a bit less than 120 over 80.
  67-72|The blood traverses the landscape of the body through the pipes of the circulatory system.
